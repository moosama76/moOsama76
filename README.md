## 🚀 What I’m Working On

I'm a developer passionate about low-level graphics, game systems, and creative tooling. My work blends real-time rendering, custom engines, CAD automation, and mathematical problem solving.

- 🔧 **Rust-first developer** — Currently building tools and libraries using Rust, `wgpu`, and `Bevy`
- 🎯 Focused on **performance**, **geometry algorithms**, and **GPU workflows**
- 📐 Strong background in **computational design** and **parametric modeling**

---

## 🧠 Key Projects

- **⚙️ GPU Particle System (WIP)** — Learning `wgpu` through compute shaders and real-time simulations  
- **📦 Bevy Add-ons** — Creating custom plugins, camera systems, and animation tweens for `Bevy`  
- **📏 CadQuery + Rust Geometry** — Automating and analyzing complex 3D shapes using CadQuery + OCC  

Check pinned repositories and recent activity for deep dives into GPU code, shaders, math libraries, and creative dev tools.
